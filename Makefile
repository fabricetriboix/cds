# names. This is because all object files go to a single build directory. Also
# ensure that no directory or file name has blank in them.

# Set D to 1 to increase verbosity
D = 0

# Set V to "release" to make a release build
# Supported variants: "debug" (default) and "release"
V = debug

# Set PLF to the platform you want to build to
# This must be one of the platform directory listed under "src/rtplf"
PLF := $(shell ./autodetectplf.py)
